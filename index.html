        <p1>There are three main types of cameras:</p1>
        <p2>
          These are the simplest to use (as the name implies) and offer the
          least amount of options when it comes to settings and manual control.
          A point-and-shoot camera also comes with a lense built into it. This
          lense can not be replaced.
        </p2>
        <p3>
          DSLRs are cameras in which the light moves through the lens and hits a
          mirror, that will redirect it to the viewfinder. This lets the
          photographer see exactly what the digital sensor will see, thus making
          it easier to frame the picture correctly.
        </p3>
        <p4>
          These are the newest type and have quickly become very popular. As
          there is no mirror in the camera, the viewfinder and the camera
          monitor are entirely electronic. As a result of this the cameras are
          typically smaller and lighter than the DSLRs.

          A camera will typically have five different modes of operation:
          automatic, program, aperture priority, shutter priority and manual.
        </h5>
        <p5>Automatic</p5>
        <p6>Aperture or shutter priority</p6>
        <p7>Manual mode</p7>
        <p8
          >The automatic mode is the simplest mode to use. All you have to do is
          click the trigger. The camera software will be in charge of all the
          settings for the image. This includes the shutter speed, the aperture,
          the ISO setting and the white balance. This is not just a great way to
          get started with taking photos, it is also a very useful setting, if
          your purpose is that of documenting where there is not a lot of time
          to mess with getting the settings right. The disadvantage is that you
          lose control the camera priorities
        </p8>
        <p9>
          In the two priority modes you gain control over either the aperture or
          the shutter speed and the camera will automatically choose the other.
          This means that in one mode you can decide the shutter speed to fit if
          your motive is still or fast moving or perhaps if you wish to add
          motion blur to your image while in the other mode you can adjust the
          aperture thus controlling the depth of field (bokeh) and let the
          camera decide on the shutter speed.Â These modes are great for fast
          photography, where you still want to retain control over one essential
          setting
